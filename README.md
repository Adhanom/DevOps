# DevOps
This repo has basic steps to setup with DevOps activities. 
You can add or modify on the steps and stages I have used in setting up DevOps environmeent. 

Automation Infrastructure and Design Configuraiton:
---------------------------------------------------
Lets say you have a server for your CI/CD configuration:
     Ubuntu Server:
            * 1TB storage with 16 GB RAM
            * Ubuntu Server with GNUM (versin 18.04 LTS)
            * Jenkins + Gitlab


 Installing your server with Ubuntu:
-----------------------------------
        * Step 1: Download Ubuntu Server LTS version (18.04 installed).
        * Step 2: Create bootable USB drive. Format USB , go to RUFUS webiste and downlaod the setup. Make bootable flash using the setup features by browsing the Ubuntu setup file from your PC local drive
        * Step 3: Insert the USB into the server and reboot the server.Press F12/F11 for booting options and choose "Boot from USB drive" 
        * Step 4: Enter profile information during the installation when promoted, such as name, username, server name and password details. Also, enter Network configuratin details: Address, host, IP and DNS etc. 
                      make sure the information s correct, check if the IP is not being used by another machine(ping before using).
        * Step 5: Finish installation
        * Step 6: Ubuntu will request login details if installatin was successful. Note: by default the Ubuntu Server does come with GUI/Interface. 
                      If you wish to have an interface like windows you need to install it using shell script. However, you must configure network durring the installation inorder to downlaod GNOME interface
        * Step 7: Update and upgrade your ubuntu package using;
                        -    sudo apt-get update              # Fetches the list of available updates
                        -    sudo apt-get upgrade   -y        # Installs some updates
                        -    sudo apt full-upgrade            # Installs full upgrade 
                        -    reboot server when completed
        * Step 8: When complted press Y when prompted "Do you want to continue?"
        * Step 9: To install GNOME use;
                       -   sudo apt-get install taskel -y
                       -   sudo taskel 
                       -   from the list of software packages, choose Ubuntu desktop by using arrow down key--press spacebar to selec it  then hit enter to to selecte OK.
                       -   run sudo taskel install ubuntu-desktop
        * Step 10: If failed after fetching files at 100% reinstall the package the same way( repeat step 9), untill you get Ubuntu login page
        * Step 11: The login screen may freeze because of graphic card driver issues. This is a bug on ubuntu. Using the following instruction to fix it.
                               - Reboot the server
                               - While rebooting keep holding the SHIFT key untill you see the Grub handler with interface--> press E then choose "Ubuntu" and hit enter
                               - Got to the line that starts with Linux ..and write NOMODESET command at the end of the word. Example, if the word is "maybe ubiquity" or "Nvidia graphics" add 
                                "Nvida graphics nomodeset" and save by pressing CTR +X
                               - Reboot the server
                               - Now you should be able to login, but you need to make a permannet change to a file inorder to login without the error for the next tme.
                               - Change the grub configuration so that the Linux kernel will not try to load the graphics driver before the display server.
                               - Open terminal (CTR + ALT + T).
                               - Write sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
                               - Youâ€™ll have to use your password to open this file. Once you have the text file opened, look for the line that contains: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash".
                                 Change this line to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset"
                               - Save the file and update the grub so that changes are taken into effect. Use this command: sudo update-grub2

Ip configration change :
-------------------------
You will need to configure the network:
      1. Write sudo /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
      2. Got to the line that starts with address and change the IP address. Be careful not to indent anything on the page
      3. Exit using Ctrl + X and Press Y to savee when promoted.
      4. Wirte ifconfig to check Or reboot.

IP is occupied by Appache Command:
------------------------------------
If the port on the Ubuntu server locking Gitlab from operating use the comman below. 

STep 1: type systemctl stop apache2.service (to stop)
Step 2: type systemctl restart apache2.service (to start again)
